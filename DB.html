					<h2>Original</h2>
					<p>The original WeightTracker application only utilized the device's local memory cache to store 
						one username and password on account creation. Furthermore, the information for the recyclerview 
						of daily weights was written in to the code to show funcitonality of design.

							<h2 class="major">Daily Weight</h2>
							<p>The Daily Weight screen showcases my abilities in the creation of tables within a database, 
								creation of values within a table, and read operations for a table.  On creation of the Daily Weight screen a table 
								is created based on the username, if the table does not already exist, so that every table is unique and 
								query structures are easier to define.  The application organizes the user's daily weights based off date in descending order 
								and also reads the columns to determine their calorie deficit for that day.  Within this activity we also have the ability to create
								 new rows for the table with the "New Entry" button.

							<h2 class="major">Goal Screen</h2>
							<p>While the Goal Screen does allow for data creation by updating the user's weight goal, the more complex data queries are seen with the 
								progression bar.  The progression bar utilizes a database query with three cursors to obtain the user's goal weight, initial weight, 
								and current weight to find the differences and display their progress.  This screen also utilizes the "LAG" action to create new columns 
								based off comparisons between data points to find out what the user's largest weight loss day was and what markers, such as calorie deficit, led 
								to that success.  This is in place to demonstrate a form of database mining where information is analyzed to help predict desired results.
								  In this case, the user will lose more weight the greater the deficit is between calorie intake and calorie expenditure for the day.
