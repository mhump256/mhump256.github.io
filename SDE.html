					<h2>Original</h2>
					<p>To properly demonstrate proficiency in Software Design and Engineering, I wanted to rework my 
						first iteration of the WeightTracker application written in Java. Since this artifact was incomplete, 
						only had a login screen that accepted any username/password, generic weight history screen, and no 
						database functionality. Not only was this application sufficient in displaying technical skills, but 
						it also provides the opportunity to show other aspects of design by creating a user interface that is 
						light weight, simple, and efficient at completing tasks that the user needs to complete their objective. 
						With this artifact, there were two objectives that I wanted to show proficiency in the ability 
						to design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles, 
						and the ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing 
						practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific 
						goals.

						<h2 class="major">Login Screen</h2>
						<p>Created a functioning login screen that verifies an existing user's credentials
							This screen also gives the new option to register a new user and limits the login
							attempts to five before shutting down the login button.  As an additional security measure, 
							the user's information is encrypted prior to database entry.

						<h2 class="major">Daily Weight</h2>
						<p>Setup a recycler view that pulls from a user-unique table within the database to display their daily
							weights along with the calorie deficit for that day.  Prior to the recycler view being updated, the database is organized
							so that the newest entry is the first one available.  New entries are done in a popup window as to limit the amount of required activities.

				<div class="inner">
					<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/Goal.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<div class="content">
						<h2 class="major">Goal Screen</h2>
						<p>Keeping with the design choice of keeping things simple, this screen is limited to progress bar that shows their current weight goal, 
							a functioning progress bar, and a text percentage for them to view. I also brought in a field for the user to update their goal so 
							that the application can continue to be functional even after the user has reached their current goal. While the screen is simple, 
							there is a lot going on in the code as I had to incorporate more database CRUD operations, data verification with tables, and algorithmic 
							principles to take multiple variables and provide an accurate value for goal completion.
